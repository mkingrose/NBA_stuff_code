                <p>
                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p> We began by scouring the internet for respected sources proiding information on basketball
                    stastisics. We wanted to look at what information was available and how those datasets could be
                    analzyed. German found
                    NBA-Reference.com, a website providing comprehensive statistics spanning decades. Our first project
                    sought to scrape, clean and render
                    these tables.</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h3>The Starting money</h3>
                <p>It's all about the prediction game. Sports are a treasure trove of data that can help provide
                    critical understandings
                    and analysis about the game directly played and some of the other venues that run parallel to its
                    presentation. We look
                    at what past data offers to find interesting future trends and how they might give insight into
                    those ancillary
                    activities. This analysis provides a place to review data to understand future salaries looking at
                    weighable stats, and
                    determine outcomes. The data set did require some changes before it was deployable. We had to remove
                    all players who
                    earned a salary last year but did not play due to injury or opted out due to pandemic. It is a
                    unique year and allows
                    for a stress test of the system and its resiliency to adapt to an unusual data set. Then had to
                    adjust for all players
                    with on two-way contract that had to be removed. Those are players on minor league deals that earn
                    $50k plus per diem
                    and get a prorated pay raise when they are called up to play in the major league. Those players
                    restrict to play a max
                    of 10 games while on a two-way contract. If the team wants a more extended period, we thought it was
                    prudent to remove
                    those players below that threshold, train, test, split, and fit the dataframe. This would be done to
                    get a more
                    authentic reflection of the salary for predictive purposes and optimal lines based on player ability
                    and salary caps.</p>

                <h3>The PER</h3>
                <p></p>The National Basketball Association has been in this game for a while - and understands the value
                of
                statisics. They have calucluated a score termed "Player Efficiency Rating" (hereafter PER), which
                measures
                the players' per-minute productivity. The considerations within this score is too complicated to discuss
                here however the scale is
                generally between 4 and 30 (the difference between a good high school player at low end and LeBron James
                setting the standard near the top). While comprehensive, the PER
                does not provide a lifetime judgement of the fundamental value of a player,
                but essentially, according to ESPN Analyst John Hollinger, "summarize a player's statistical
                accomplishments in a single number." And voila, a main component of our
                job had been done for us by those handy NBA officials. We could now get to work scoring the PER
                against other statistics and salary metrix.</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h3>The Stats</h3>
                <p></p>We calculated the salary contracted for each NBA player for the 2019-2020 season and
                cross-referenced them against their statisitics.
                These included points scored, blocks, assists, rebounds, fouls, minutes played and games played.
                Each of these provided additional
                context for the player's PER. Our Statistics webpage allows the viewer to analyze the salaries of
                players by team and their PER.</p>

                <h3>The Starting money</h3>
                <p></p>One of the keys to components understanding NBA teams is understanding the salary of a team.
                Looking over a three-year move through their payments and the money they paid towards their
                salary caps provides an initial understanding of how to break things down across players.</p>
